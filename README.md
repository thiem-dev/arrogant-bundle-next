## Overview

- The Objective of this project was to create a 1 for 1 copy of the Humble Bundle page: https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-mario-rpg-switch

- Note: The original project was shutdown due to problems with Render hosting service. We have revived the project with Nextjs (updated api code, not a full rewrite)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
